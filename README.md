These are kicad schematics and design files for PCBs used in the EMS
weather-balloon external sensor board project. These design files are
being released (as of this writing on the 30th of April, 2016) under
the CERN Open Hardware License v1.2 (see file LICENSE.txt for text of
the license).  All future versions of the CERN Open Hardware License
automatically apply.

The PCB uses an ATMEGA32u4 microcontroller to gather information from
various sensor modules, including a weather monitoring chip, and
several photodiodes with varying wavelength-range sensitivities that
together approximate a poor man's low-resolution spectrometer. The PCB
footprints for most modules are designed to match breakout boards
available from Adafruit Industries (see BOM file for details).
